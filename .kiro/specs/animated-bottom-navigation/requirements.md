# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement an animated magic bottom navigation bar that replaces the current Expo Router tabs with a custom animated navigation component. The navigation will feature a floating indicator that smoothly transitions between tabs, with icons that animate upward when selected and text labels that fade in/out. The design will maintain the existing 5-tab structure (Home, Shops, Cart, Orders, Profile) while adding sophisticated animations and visual effects including a transparent floating button gap.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visually appealing animated bottom navigation bar so that I can easily navigate between app sections with delightful visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the navigation bar SHALL display with a white background, rounded corners, and proper positioning at the bottom
2. WHEN a tab is active THEN the navigation bar SHALL show a circular indicator positioned above the active tab
3. WHEN the navigation bar is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain a fixed height of 70px and width that adapts to screen size
4. WHEN the navigation bar is displayed THEN it SHALL have proper shadows and visual depth to appear floating

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see smooth animations when switching between tabs so that the interface feels responsive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap on a different tab THEN the circular indicator SHALL smoothly animate to the new tab position within 0.5 seconds
2. WHEN a tab becomes active THEN the icon SHALL animate upward by 32px with smooth transition
3. WHEN a tab becomes inactive THEN the icon SHALL animate back to its original position
4. WHEN a tab becomes active THEN the text label SHALL fade in and move upward with opacity transition
5. WHEN a tab becomes inactive THEN the text label SHALL fade out and move downward

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to integrate seamlessly with React Native navigation so that routing works correctly across the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap on a navigation tab THEN the app SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen using Expo Router
2. WHEN the active route changes THEN the navigation SHALL update to reflect the current active tab
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the app SHALL maintain proper navigation state and history
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL correctly identify and highlight the current active route

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to display appropriate icons and labels so that I can easily identify each section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation renders THEN it SHALL display Home, Shops, Cart, Orders, and Profile tabs with appropriate icons
2. WHEN a tab is active THEN it SHALL show both the icon and text label
3. WHEN a tab is inactive THEN it SHALL show only the icon with the text label hidden
4. WHEN icons are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent sizing and proper color theming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the floating indicator to have visual depth and proper styling so that it stands out as the active element.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the indicator is displayed THEN it SHALL have a circular shape with tomato/orange background color
2. WHEN the indicator is rendered THEN it SHALL have a border that matches the app background color
3. WHEN the indicator is positioned THEN it SHALL extend above the navigation bar by 50% of its height
4. WHEN the indicator is shown THEN it SHALL have curved shadow elements on both sides for visual depth
5. WHEN the indicator transitions THEN the transparent gap SHALL be visible beneath the floating button

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to be maintainable and follow React Native best practices so that it can be easily updated and debugged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is implemented THEN it SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN the component is created THEN it SHALL follow React Native styling conventions
3. WHEN animations are implemented THEN they SHALL use React Native Animated API or Reanimated for performance
4. WHEN the component is structured THEN it SHALL be modular and reusable
5. WHEN the component handles state THEN it SHALL properly manage active tab state and transitions

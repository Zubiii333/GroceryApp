# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project's TypeScript configuration is currently broken due to a missing base configuration file. The tsconfig.json file extends "expo/tsconfig.base" which cannot be found, preventing proper TypeScript compilation and IDE support. This feature will resolve the TypeScript configuration issues and ensure proper type checking and compilation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working TypeScript configuration, so that I can develop with proper type checking and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN it SHALL successfully resolve the base configuration without errors
2. WHEN opening TypeScript files in the IDE THEN the IDE SHALL provide proper type checking and IntelliSense
3. WHEN building the project THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without configuration errors
4. IF the Expo SDK is installed THEN the configuration SHALL properly extend Expo's TypeScript settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper path mapping configuration, so that I can use absolute imports with the "@/*" alias.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing files using "@/" prefix THEN TypeScript SHALL resolve the paths correctly
2. WHEN using path aliases in components THEN the IDE SHALL provide proper autocomplete and navigation
3. WHEN building the project THEN path aliases SHALL be resolved correctly during compilation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive file inclusion settings, so that all relevant TypeScript files are processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript processes the project THEN it SHALL include all .ts and .tsx files
2. WHEN Expo types are available THEN they SHALL be included in the compilation
3. WHEN environment declaration files exist THEN they SHALL be properly included
4. WHEN adding new TypeScript files THEN they SHALL be automatically included based on the glob patterns
